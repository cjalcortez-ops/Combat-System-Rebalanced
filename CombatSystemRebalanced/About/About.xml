    Combat System Rebalanced reworks how armor and damage interact in RimWorld, 
    reducing RNG dominance and creating fairer, more tactical combat. 
    
    ✦ Features:
    • Dynamic damage reduction that scales with penetration vs armor difference.  
    • Removes the extreme all-or-nothing armor checks, ensuring even strong armor can be chipped away.  
    • Prevents late-game armored enemies (such as modded mech suits) from becoming invulnerable walls.  
    • Shifts combat towards balance and strategy, where both equipment and tactics matter more than luck.  

    ✦ Compatibility:
    • Works fully standalone.  
    • Designed to be compatible with most combat-related mods.  
    • Optional load order tags included for flexibility.  

    Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
